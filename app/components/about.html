              I am a skilled and detail-oriented Frontend Developer with 3 years of experience in building responsive, user-focused web applications. Proficient in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), and modern framework - React. I specialize in transforming UI/UX designs into interactive, scalable, and maintainable interfaces. My expertise extends to creating mobile-first, cross-browser compatible websites that deliver seamless experiences across devices.

              I have a deep understanding of JavaScript and its modern features, and I excel in crafting dynamic single-page applications (SPAs) using React, where I leverage hooks and component-based architecture for state management and efficient rendering. My proficiency in CSS (including Grid, Flexbox, and preprocessors like Sass/SCSS) allows me to develop visually appealing, responsive layouts.

              Collaboration is key to my success â€” I work closely with designers and backend developers to ensure projects meet high-quality standards. I am adept at integrating with RESTful APIs and optimizing performance by employing techniques such as lazy loading, code splitting, and asset optimization to reduce load times.

              Additionally, I prioritize testing and code quality by utilizing tools like Jest, Cypress, and Mocha, ensuring reliable, bug-free applications. Familiar with Git methodology, I contribute effectively to team-based projects, ensuring smooth collaboration and timely delivery.
